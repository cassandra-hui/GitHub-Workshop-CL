## Step 2: Clone the Repository in GitHub Desktop

1. Open **GitHub Desktop**.
2. If the repository is **not** already cloned, click **File > Clone Repository** and select your repository from the list.
3. If it‚Äôs already cloned, make sure it‚Äôs selected from the repository dropdown at the top.

## Step 3: Switch to the New Branch in GitHub Desktop

1. In GitHub Desktop, click the **Current Branch** button in the top middle of the window.
2. Select the new branch you created (e.g., `new-feature`) from the list.
   - If the branch is not listed, click **Fetch Origin** to sync your local repository with GitHub.

## Step 4: Make Changes Locally

1. Open the repository folder on your computer.
2. Make changes to any file (e.g., edit `README.md` or create a new file).
3. Save your changes.

---

## Step 5: Commit Changes to the Branch

1. Go back to **GitHub Desktop**. You should see your changes listed under **Changes**.
2. Add a commit message describing your changes (e.g., "Updated README.md with feature details").
3. Click **Commit to new-feature** to save your changes to the branch.

---

## Step 6: Push the Changes to GitHub.com

1. After committing, click the **Push Origin** button at the top in GitHub Desktop.
2. This will upload your changes to the `new-feature` branch on GitHub.com.

---

## Step 7: Verify Changes on GitHub.com

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.com.
2. Switch to the `new-feature` branch using the branch dropdown.
3. Verify that the changes you made locally are reflected in the branch on GitHub.com.

## Step 8: Merge the Branch into the Main Branch

You should see a new `Compare & pull request` button. You can click that and move on to step 4. Or start from the begining.
